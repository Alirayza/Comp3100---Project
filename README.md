w11-w13: Multiple Commits in "Assignment 2" folder file - 1. "TCPClien.java" and "ServerClass.java" should contain commits from week 11 to week 13.

Final Solution:

Final Working Solution Java file is in "Assignment 2". Final Java file is ONLY: 1. TCPClient.java. Please Ignore "ServerClass.java" file as it is NOT needed anymore. It is only there because it got some commits.
